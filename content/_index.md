Welcome to the Open Source Kitchen!
===================================
We're glad you've come to the Open Source Kitchen! This is some basic text about the site, which I'm filling in kind of randomly in order to simulate as if there's some content here. There's nothing here yet, but someday there likely will be, and we'd like to ensure that we promote as much food as we can as beautifully as possible, so filling this space with text helps us to ensure that the website looks alright.
